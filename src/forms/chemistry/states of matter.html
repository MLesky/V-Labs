					<h2>States of Matter</h2>
					<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Describe how the concept of density relates to an object's mass and volume.</li>
						<li>Explain how objects of similar mass can have differing volume, and how objects of similar
							volume can have differing mass.</li>
						<li>Explain why changing an object's mass or volume does not affect its density (ie, understand
							density as an intensive property).</li>
						<li>Measure the volume of an object by observing the amount of fluid it displaces.</li>
						<li>Identify an unknown material by calculating its density and comparing to a table of known
							densities.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here are the steps to perform the Experiment on the States of Matter:</p>
					<ol>
						<p>Aim:o investigate the three states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) and observe how they can
							change from one state to another.</p>
						<p>Materials:Ice cubes
							Water,
							Heat source (e.g. hot plate or stove),
							Glass beaker,
							Thermometer,
							Measuring cup,
							Plastic bag</p>
						<p>Procedures</p>
						<li>Fill a glass beaker with water and place a thermometer in the water to measure the
							temperature.</li>
						<li>Place a few ice cubes in the water and observe what happens to the ice as it comes into
							contact with the water.</li>
						<li>Heat the beaker on a heat source until the water begins to boil. Observe the steam that is
							produced as the water changes from a liquid to a gas</li>
						<li>Pour some of the water into a plastic bag and seal the bag tightly. Place the bag in the
							freezer and observe what happens to the water as it changes from a liquid to a solid.</li>
						<p>Observation</p>
						<p>When the ice cubes are added to the water, they begin to melt and turn into liquid water. As
							the water is heated, it begins to boil and produce steam as it changes from a liquid to a
							gas. When the water in the plastic bag is frozen, it turns into a solid block of ice.</p>
